# About

## Overview
Vehicles have penetrated virtually every industry and made themselves essential to many services that are commonplace today. However, most vehicles are expensive investments that also require care and upkeep throughout ownership including routine maintenance and costly sudden repairs. Modern vehicles warn the driver of potential signs of something that needs attention on the dash or through a phone app, but a more scalable solution would be extremely useful for a corporation or business that owns an entire fleet of vehicles. DataDriven is an end-to-end solution that collects live data from vehicles, uploads it to the cloud, and makes it available on a dashboard for analysis. Data from onboard sensors can be used to course-correct the health of vehicles through preventative and predictive maintenance. This system empowers its users to make informed and high-impact decisions that minimize costs and maximize efficiency.

*TODO: add a timeline of accomplishments, demos, system architecture, and more project details*
